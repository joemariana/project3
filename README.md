I have made a Sample Software Company Website called Tecky Software.

The website is build using html, css, bootstrap.

I used bootstrap for icons and logos.

Made the css using parallax effect.

Added a backend using MERN (MongoDB Express React Nodejs)

The mongodb is added to my mongodb compass.

I have hosted the website in internet using netlify.

I have added a feedback back at the end of my website and data is collected using Formspree.

Formspree website contains the data entered in the form.
